# Pantry

You need NPM installed

Once NPM is installed you need to run "npm i" from the command line in the frontend root folder

Once the Node_Modules have been installed, you need to run "npm i -g @vue/cli"

Once the Vue CLI has been installed, you need to run the command "npm run serve" in the root folder of the Frontend Project. This will start the frontend up on a local server. To access the server you need to go to "localhost:8080" in your web browser
